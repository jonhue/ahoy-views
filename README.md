## Installation

**Note:** Before installing Ahoy Views make sure to setup the original [Ahoy](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy) gem.

Ahoy Views works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy-views'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ahoy_views

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy-views', github: 'jonhue/ahoy-views'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g ahoy_views

Lastly make sure to call `ahoy_views` from your `Ahoy::Event` class:

```ruby
module Ahoy
    class Event < ApplicationRecord
        ahoy_views
    end
end
```

---

## Usage

### Tracking

You can track views for ActiveRecord objects from your controllers:

```ruby
class ArticleController < ApplicationController

    def index
        @articles = Article.all
        ahoy_view @articles
    end

    def show
        @article = Article.find params[:id]
        ahoy_view @article
    end

end
```

**Note:** This will create an `Ahoy::Event` object for every record passed.

The `current_visit` object, if present, will be automatically associated with every visit.

You are also able to associate other records with views. [Learn more](#ahoy_viewer).

#### Types

You can pass an array of `types` to `ahoy_view`. Types allow you to track multiple types of visits. The `:types` option defaults to `[:view]`.

```ruby
ahoy_view @article, types: [:view, :visitor, :returnee, :unique_visitor, :unique_returnee]
```

Here is a list of available types:

* `:view` stores every call to `ahoy_view` for an object.

* `:visitor` stores only one view per visit.

* `:returnee` stores only one view per visit if the visitor has viewed the object before.

* `:unique_visitor` stores only one view per visitor.

* `:unique_returnee` stores only one view per visitor if the visitor has viewed the object before.

### `ahoy_viewable`

Add `ahoy_viewable` to an ActiveRecord class.

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
    ahoy_viewable
end

a = Article.first

# All belonging Ahoy::Event objects that are a view
a.ahoy_views

# All viewer records that have a view object
a.ahoy_viewers

# Scope to order Article records by views
Article.trending

# Whether or not a is one of the 5 "most trending" articles
a.trending? 5
```

### `ahoy_viewer`

Add `ahoy_viewer` to an ActiveRecord class.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    ahoy_viewer
end

u = User.first

# All belonging Ahoy::Event objects that are a view
u.ahoy_visits

# All records that this user has taken a look at
u.ahoy_viewed
```

Here is how to associate a viewer with a view:

```ruby
ahoy_view @article, viewer: current_user
```
