## Installation

**Note:** Before installing Ahoy Views make sure to setup the original [Ahoy](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy) gem.

Ahoy Views works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy-views'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ahoy_views

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'ahoy-views', github: 'jonhue/ahoy-views'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g ahoy_views

Lastly make sure to call `ahoy_views` from your `Ahoy::Event` class:

```ruby
module Ahoy
    class Event < ApplicationRecord
        ahoy_views
    end
end
```
